This project involves creating a Windows Forms application that offers a basic Facebook experience along with two unique features not available on the official Facebook website. The application is designed to provide relevant value to users while ensuring ease of use. In the second phase, the project was enhanced by incorporating data binding, synchronization, and design patterns to improve functionality and maintainability.
